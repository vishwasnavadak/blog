If you have been around me, then you would have already asked me why my palms are sweaty. I have been answering that question for more than 20 years now. It's due to a medical condition called **Hyperhidrosis**. Since it is observed in only 3% of the people worldwide and most of the people I meet on daily basis are from rest 97% of world population, getting the question "Why you are sweating sooo much?!" at least 3 times a week is quite normal.

It doesn't stop there. The **Why** question is always followed by what, when and how questions. That made me list down a few of the FAQs(Frequently Asked Questions) faced by a person with Hyperhidrosis.

### 1. Why are you sweating so much?
Because I have something called Hyperhidrosis. Wikipedia defines it as *a condition characterized by abnormally increased sweating, in excess of that required for regulation of body temperature.*

### 2. Okay, but why only hands?
Because I am born with a hell lot of sweat glands on my hand. 

### 3. Is it some kind of disease? Have you tried *XYZ* type of medicine, it might work.
No, it is caused by caused by over-activity of the sympathetic nervous system(I have no idea what that means). Yes, I have consulted all type of doctors already, nobody seems to have a working fix.

### 4. I haven't seen anybody like this.
You should try to socialize and meet more people. You will get, eventually.

### 5. Why don't to you try surgical procedures?
I don't like stitches on my hand, unlike Frankenstein's monster. Also, not a fan of lasers and Botox injections.

### 6. How do you feel when it sweats? Does it pain or something?
Do you feel pain when you sweat? I don't.

### 7. Do you face difficulties with sweaty palms?
Most of the fingerprint sensors will not recognize **wet fingers**, notebooks are not expected to have waterproof papers. Still not convinced? Try operating your phone and laptop with wet palms. You'll know. 

Let me know if you are one of **the kind** and face questions like this often by tweeting me @<a href="https://twitter.com/vishwasnavadak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vishwasnavadak</a>.
